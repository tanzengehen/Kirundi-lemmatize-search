    <h2>1. Lemmatise</h2>
    <p>Match the individual words to their keyword&nbsp;(lemma) in the dictionary:<br> 
        e.g. sort inflected verbs to the infinitive or declined nouns to the nominative singular<br><br>
    
    <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frequency distribution</b><br>
    Create a table according to the frequency of lemmata used in the text<br><br>
    
    <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determining the Part of Speech</b><br>
    Mark the Part of Speech of the individual words<br><br>
    
    <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lemma-soup</b><br>
    Create a text variant in which the individual words are replaced by their lemma</p>
    <h3><a name=how_lemmatize>And this is how the Lemmatiser works:</a></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the file you want to analyse:<br>
            only txt-files are accepted</li>
        <li>Click „Lemmata“</li>
        <li>Some statistical values appear in the lower window
            <ul>
                <li>Number of proper names, adverbs, pronouns, nouns, adjectives, verbs, ...</li>
                <li>Number of characters in the text</li>
                <li>Number of tokens in the text (roughly corresponds to the number of words)</li>
                <li>Number of different words (size of the vocabulary) </li>
                <li>Percentage of words that the dictionary could not categorise<br>
                    These can be spelling mistakes or proper names and words that are not yet listed and should be added to the dictionary as soon as possible<br>
                    (you can find out how you can help with this here: <a href="#how_contribute">Contribute</a>)
                </li>
                <li>the version of the dictionary used</li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>There are then four new files in the "results/tagged" folder:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>- Frequency distribution:</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;fl__dateiname.csv</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>- Text labelled with Part of Speech and lemma:</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;<b>tag__dateiname.csv</b></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>- Normalised text:</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;norm__dateiname.txt</td>
                </tr><tr>
                    <td>- Text variant with lemmata only:</td>
                    <td>&nbsp;lemma__dateiname.txt</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>2. <a name="how_search">Search</a></h2>
    <p>When searching in the text, individual words, keywords and word types can be combined.<br>
       The search is based on a file in the format <b>tag__dateinname.csv</b><br>
       If you have already labelled the text in the past, it is quicker if you read this tag_file directly.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the file you want to search in:<br>
            only txt-files or a tag__filename.csv are accepted
        </li>
        <li>Click "Lemmata":<br>
            tag__dateinname.csv is read or created<br>
            (but this is only necessary if you have searched in another file directly before)<br>
            Some statistical data appears in the lower area
        </li>
        <li>Enter your search query (N-grams)<br>
            The following rules apply:
            <ul>
                <li>You can search for colourful expressions, i.e. you can combine word types and words and lemmas as you like</li>
                <li>By default, lemmata are searched for and all associated word forms are collected</li>
                <li>A / before a /word only allows exact hits for this word</li>
                <li>A ! directly before a !word explicitly excludes this word (or this lemma or this PoS) from the search</li>
                <li>A free-standing * is a placeholder for any token at this position. It only applies to words, not to individual letters.</li>
                <li>The Lemmatiser distinguishes between the following <a href="help_enPoS.html">PoS-tags</a>:</li>
            </ul>
            As you enter your search query, you can see in the field below whether the programme has understood you correctly.
        </li>
        <li>Click „Search“</li>
        <li>The first 20 text passages that match your query appear in the lower window
            <ul>
                <li>the number at the beginning indicates the character in the text at which the hit begins</li>
                <li>a few words before and after the hit are also displayed as context</li>
            </ul></li>
        <li>
            In the "results/searched" folder, you will find a file in which all the results of this search are saved.<br>
            It is named after your search query: filename_search_terms_.txt
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. <a name="how_contribute">Contribute</a></h2>
    <p>The underlying dictionary is not complete:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can check words marked as unknown and categorise them.<br>
        Some words are ambiguous:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can report errors.<br>
        Or make suggestions to increase user convenience.<br><br>
        Just send an email to <b>deki.kazinduzi@gmail.com</b><br>
        I am happy to receive feedback in order to continuously improve the Lemmatiser.<br>
